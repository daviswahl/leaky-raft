#Usage
DONT

This is a learning implementation of [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) in Rust. It is based on tokio.

This repository might be useful to you if you're interested in learning raft or rust or tokio, but it will not be useful
if you need a working impl of raft. [This one looks better.](https://github.com/pingcap/raft-rs)
